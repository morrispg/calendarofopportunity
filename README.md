# calendarofopportunity

This project allowed me to integrate JQuery and Bootstrap with HTML, CSS and JS. Figuring out the format was a challenge. Additionally, applying the correct format for day.js took some trial and error. This work contains small snippets of code from my instructor, my tutor, and the day.js site. Learning to create a site that has real-time functionality feels like a great stride forward.
